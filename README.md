# 🗑️ Smart Bin — IoT Project

An automated smart dustbin designed using embedded systems and IoT principles to promote hygienic, touchless waste disposal and efficient waste segregation.

---

## 🔧 Project Overview

The Smart Bin automatically detects a user's hand using an ultrasonic sensor and opens the lid via a servo motor. It is designed to improve sanitation and automate waste handling in public or residential areas.

---

## 🧠 Features

- **Touchless Operation:** Lid opens automatically when a hand is detected.
- **Sensor-Based Control:** Uses ultrasonic sensor for distance detection.
- **Compact Circuit Design:** Built with Arduino Uno, servo motor, and supporting components.
- **Educational Purpose:** Ideal for smart systems, embedded programming, and prototyping.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Power on the bin.**
2. **Sensor detects object (hand) within a certain range.**
3. **Servo motor rotates to open the lid.**
4. **After a delay, the lid automatically closes.**
